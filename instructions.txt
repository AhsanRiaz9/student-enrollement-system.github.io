I just started learning HTML CSS and javascript.
this project is using all 3 of them and bootstrap to create a sample student enrollment form.
1.all fields of the form should have necessary validations
2. using javascript, add each student's information to the table dynamically
3. image should be loaded from the URL submitted, website link can be open in a new tab
4. using CSS animations, new enrollment should be added with a fade-in effect achieved
